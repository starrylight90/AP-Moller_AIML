,,
1,Dataset:,Every row represents the sourcing of one unit of a particular product combination.
,,"A unique product combination comprises of attributes mentioned in Columns A,B,C,D,E,F"
,,"Since each row represents 1 unit of sourcing; therefore, you will find multiple rows with the same combination in the training dataset. Imagine buying 1 quantity being represented as a single row."
,,July 20 to May 21 is your training set and June 21 is your test set; So using the 11 months data (Training Set: June 2020 to May 2021) you'd have the forecast / predict the June 2021 number (Test Set)
,,June 2021 has only a single value for each combination as that is your test set (target).
,,Hint: You may need to download this dataset to work  upon it.
,,
2,Problem:,Iterate on ML models to come up closest to the Test set data using the Training Set Data.
,,
3,What is expected:,Understand the data set (even with the open questions you have)
,,Do Exploratory Data Analysis.
,,Use Python and it's libraries for all your development needs.
,,Have a strategy for handling outliers / poor data quality on some rows.
,,Come up with approaches for forecasting the June 21 test set.
,,Compare and explain the different approaches you might have considered. (In your notebook)
,,Explain the final approach you have taken and why. (In your notebook)
,,
4,What you need to share:,Share your (Jyupiter) notebook.
,,Share your Github Repo with final solution in Python.
